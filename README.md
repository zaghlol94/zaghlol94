ZAG is a machine learning engineer who has a MS.c degree in Data Science (Computer Science) from Paderborn University, Specializing in filling the gap between
the research in Machine/Deep learning theory and the software industry by implementing state-of-the-art models and scaling them to operate well in scalable
/reliable data project pipeline has in-depth theoretical knowledge and hands-on
experience in a diverse set of ML/DL libraries with 5 years of professional experience in
implementing ML/DL across multiple domains.
